    <h1>WE THE LIVING</h1>
    <p>yn Rand's theme in We the Living is the supreme value of an individual life, and the evil of a state 
        that claims the right to take and sacrifice that life. Rand held that each individual has a moral 
        right to live for his own sake, to pursue his own personal happiness.</p>
    <h1>THE FOUNTAIN HEAD</h1>
    <p>The Fountainhead is a 1943 novel by Russian-American author Ayn Rand, her first major literary success.
         The novel's protagonist, Howard Roark, is an intransigent young architect, who battles against
          conventional standards and r
          efuses to compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to
           accept innovation.</p>
